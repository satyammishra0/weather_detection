This is my weather detetction website

Hello üëã I am Satyam Mishra

This is the weather detection app which shows weather in a particular city entered in a input field.
It shows the temperature and type of weather in the searched location.
Which uses an API of weathermap.org (https://api.openweathermap.org) so special thanks to them for providing such APIs freely
its so easy and helpful to use.
